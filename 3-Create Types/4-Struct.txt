1-Difference with Class:
	a. Value type
	b. Doesn't support Inheritance (other than deriving from object/System.ValueType)
	c. Can have all members from a class, except:
		Parameterless constructor
		Finalizer
		Virtual Members
	d. Does not instantiate instance on the heap (save time):
		Creating an array of value-type, only 1 heap allocation

2-Contructor
	a. Parameterless constructor
		Implicitly exists, can't be overriden
		bitwise zeroing

	b. Customized constructor:
		Must assign each field

	c. Can't use field initializers in struct
