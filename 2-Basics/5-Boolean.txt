1-Storage:
	require 1 bit
	runtime use 1 byte of memory (minimum chunck, RT and processor can work efficiently)
	BitArray (in System.Collections): 1 bit/bool

2-Conversion:
	No conversion bool <--> numerics

3-Compare:
	Value type
	Ref type: based on reference
		obj1 == obj2 //false
		exception: string

4-Operators(conditional)
	Short-circut evaluation:
		&&, ||
	Non short-circut:
		!, &, | (differ from c++, bitwise operator: only applied to numbers)
	Ternary operator:
		(a>b) ? a : b
